  - Boss scripts and stats align with the Japanese release of FF4.
  - Asura summon spell now casts Armor, Cure3 or Life1.

- Kstats:et
  - Boss scripts and stats align with the Easy Type release of FF4.

- H Flags
  - Hrandom (default) makes the harp song a random selection from a smaller pool than the original.
  - Hvanilla makes Edward take all requests as long as it's "Melody of Lute".
  - Hnone makes Edward play air harp.
